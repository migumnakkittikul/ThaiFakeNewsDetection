# Thai Fake News Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project implements a **Fake News Detection System** for Thai-language news articles using a deep learning approach. It leverages a **Bi-LSTM with an Attention Mechanism** and engineered features to classify news articles as **Fake News** or **Fact News**.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Bi-LSTM with Attention for contextual understanding of text.
- **Thai Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization and cleaning using PyThaiNLP.
- **Engineered Features**: Adds numerical features such as Thai character ratio and number of URLs.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances the `Fake News` class using word-dropping and shuffling techniques.
- **Interactive Testing**: Test the model with custom titles and content directly within the notebook.
